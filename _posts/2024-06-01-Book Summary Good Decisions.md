Summaries of books on good decisions

## The Signal and The Noise, by Nate Silver
"Big data" (or rich information) does not guarantee good decisions
- Human's biological instincts are not always well adapted to a data-rich modern world with biases
- Problematic to apply System 1 intuitive thinking to complex problems with which we have no experience
- The shortcut when we have too much information is to engage with it selectively
- To use millions of data to explain a few outputs, many patterns it identifies will be spurious and overfitted
- While simpler statements are more believable as they sound like greater truth or grander theory, Tetlock (in superforecasting) found that hedgehogs are very poor at predictions; they leave out messy bits that make life real and predictions more accurate

Issues in economic forecasting
- According to Hatzius, 3 challenges: **1)** hard to determine cause and effect; **2)** the economy is always changing, so past behavior may not apply to future; **3)** the data is not good
- Goodhart's Law: once policy makers begin to target a certain variable, it begins to lose its value as an economic indicator
- If you simply treat the economy as a series of data, variables and equations without underlying structure, you will certainly mistake noise for signal

**Bayesian** Approach
- Requires us to start with a **prior**, a hypothesis of cause and effect, and use new data to update the prior. This is key to separate "signal and the noise" from big data
- "Frequentist" approach views uncertainty as intrinsic to the experiment, rather than intrinsic to our ability to understand the real world. Frequentist approaches do not encourage us to think about which correlations imply causation
- Example: Bob Voulgaris uses basketball knowledge to form hypotheses instead of just looking at statistical patterns, which everyone sees
- Example: good poker is inherently a Bayesian approach. Data is so scarce that people start to form priors (other's hand range) even before cards are dealt
- Example: breast cancer example shows false positives are a problem without Bayesian thinking
