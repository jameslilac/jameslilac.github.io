# Project Superforecasting
Summarize key ideas from Superforecasting, Nate Silver book, and other similar books

Should broaden goal from investing to "decision science" - make better decision odds

Key concept of machine learning that finds a "cohesive narrative" with cause and effects from the data. The narrative needs to be "stable", i.e., does not change erratically with new information, or noise

One intemediate step is for AI to summarize all relevant information related to a decision: how to determina what is relevant?

Prioritize building on top of existing infrastructure

Some research directions:
1. Bayesian Deep Learning: better at handling uncertainty, and data efficiency, relevant for decision making
2. Time series LLMs: model time series data specifically
3. Recurrency to improve data efficiency and reasoning: see coconut, tiny resursive models
