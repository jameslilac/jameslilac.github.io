## Writing Posts

Posts are written in Markdown and stored in the `_posts/` directory. Each post filename should follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

Example post structure:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2026-01-07
---

Your post content in Markdown format goes here.
```

## Formatting
Good resource is [StackEdit](stackedit.io)
